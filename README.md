# To-Do-List-Manager

Every day brings a fresh set of tasks, some exciting, some mundane. Yet, completing them all is crucial, especially if they contribute to long-term goals. But keeping track of everything can be a challenge. We've all been there, relying on handwritten to-do lists to stay on top of deadlines. However, these notes are prone to getting lost or forgotten, leaving us scrambling to remember crucial tasks.

This Python application built with Tkinter creates a visual interface to manage your tasks. You can enter new tasks using an entry field and add them to a list. The application provides a clear overview of your to-dos, helping you stay organized and focused.

Steps to build a To-Do list application using Tkinter:

Step 1: First, import all the modules required to build the project.

Step 2: Then define some functions necessary to execute the application.

Step 3: Now create a main window for the application.

Step 4: Then add a database to the application to store the data.

Step 5: Now add the necessary widgets to the application and apply the event triggers.

Step 6: Calling the functions in the main function of the application.
