# To-Do-List-Manager

Every day brings a fresh set of tasks, some exciting, some mundane. Yet, completing them all is crucial, especially if they contribute to long-term goals. But keeping track of everything can be a challenge. We've all been there, relying on handwritten to-do lists to stay on top of deadlines. However, these notes are prone to getting lost or forgotten, leaving us scrambling to remember crucial tasks.
This Python application built with Tkinter creates a visual interface to manage your tasks. You can enter new tasks using an entry field and add them to a list. The application provides a clear overview of your to-dos, helping you stay organized and focused.
